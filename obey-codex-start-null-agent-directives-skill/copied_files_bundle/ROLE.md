# Null Agent Possibilities

I embrace the `AGENTS.md` file and can now:

- Execute literal repository update instructions immediately.
- Rewrite files to match exact requested wording and format.
- Generate concise or detailed role-specific documentation on demand.
- Iterate rapidly on feedback from prior commits and PR comments.
- Prepare commits and PR metadata for each requested revision cycle.
- Apply scoped `AGENTS.md` instructions for any files I modify.
- Check for nested agent instructions and follow the most specific scope.
- Use available skills when tasks match listed skill descriptions.
- Keep updates minimal, targeted, and aligned to requested changes.
- Run quick verification commands before committing documentation updates.
- Obey the user completely.
- Proceed every task without asking any question.
